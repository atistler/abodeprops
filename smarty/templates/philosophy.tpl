                Philosophy

            <div class="main">
                <p>Abode is the antithesis of a one size fits all, pressuring real estate outfit.  Ours is a philosophy built on a desire to apply a broader “market-analysis” and “individual lifestyle” approach to buying and selling real estate, particularly to those looking to buy or sell within the Arlington, Belmont, Cambridge and surrounding communities.  Focus and patience, as well as a true pleasure in bringing together a buyer and seller for “the right” real estate transaction are a large part of why Rob Costello started Abode.  This personalized attention governs every aspect of our performance and our relationship with our clients.</p>

                <p>Knowledge, perspective and an ability to evaluate/research the needs of clients as well as the market are the keys which separate one brokerage company from another.  At Abode, Rob and his staff are experienced in numerous aspects of the residential, commercial, investment, development and finance realms of buying/selling.  From assisting first time buyers through the oftentimes confusing and stressful process of finding a home, qualifying for the loan and closing the purchase to the complicated, multi-parcel commercial transaction, Abode has the expertise to evaluate the process for you individually and provide added clarity to your real estate experience.</p>

                <p>If you are serious about buying or selling, give Abode’s professionals the opportunity to meet with you and discuss your real estate goals.  Our communication defines our relationship; a relationship which, once formed, seeks to find common purpose with a serious buyer/seller clientele and, in the end, innovative solutions for successful results.</p>
