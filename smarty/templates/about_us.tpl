                <h4>Rob Costello:</h4>
                <p>
                Abode Properties Inc.’s Principal, Rob is a passionate real estate investor
                and market follower/strategist. Having grown up in Lexington, Rob lived on the West Coast, Mid-Atlantic
                and Western Massachusetts before returning to the Boston area, ultimately settling in Arlington; his
                having resided in so many locations provides a unique perspective on the needs/desires of local
                residents, neighborhoods and the varied benefits/strengths of the local communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition to a law degree, Rob holds a graduate degree in international development / relations, the
                latter of which has significantly aided his ability to look at the financial and personal needs of real
                estate buyers and sellers, both in relation to the specific property they are looking to buy or sell, as
                well as how that purchase or sale fits into their broader life plan.
